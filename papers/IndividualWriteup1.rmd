# Abstract

Despite alternative facts to the contrary, rapid, anthropogenic climate change is
not only real, but arguably the most dangerous threat (in the mid- to long-term)
facing human societies [@UCS2000]. Given this unprecedented challenge, climate
scientists have developed computational models to predict spatio-temporal
changes in global climate under a variety of scenarios and assumptions [@Hawkins2009].
Using these models in any analysis that goes beyond comparing apocalyptic futures,
however, comes with a serious caveat. Estimates of model uncertainty do not
necessarily indicate actual climate uncertainty. Thus building policy based on these
models implies a sense of certainty that we cannot reasonably expect
[@Larose2005].
