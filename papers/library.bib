abstract = {Abstract Faced by the realities of a changing climate, decision makers in a wide variety of organizations are increasingly seeking quantitative predictions of regional and local climate. An important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is the potential for climate science to deliver improvements?especially reductions in uncertainty?in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction uncertainty.},

@article{Knutti2010,
abstract = {1 The trillion dollar garden party—an analogy Imagine you are hosting a garden party tomorrow and you are trying to decide whether or not to put up a tent against the rain. You read the weather forecast in the newspaper and you ask the farmer next door, and you look at the sky (knowing that persistence is often not a bad weather forecast). So you get three predictions, but how would you aggregate them? Would you average them with equal weight? You might trust the forecast model more (or less) than the farmer, not because you understand how either of them generates their prediction, but because of your past experience in similar situations. But why seek advice from more than one source in the first place? We intuitively assume that the combined information from multiple sources improves our understanding and therefore our ability to decide. Now having read one newspaper forecast already, would a second and a third one increase your confidence? That seems unlikely, because you know that all newspaper forecasts are based on one of only a few numerical weather prediction models. Now once you have decided on a set of forecasts, and irrespective of whether they agree or not, you will have to synthesize the different pieces of information and decide about the tent for the party. The optimal decision probably involves more than just the most likely prediction. If the damage without the tent is likely to be large, and if putting up the tent is easy, then you might go for the tent in a case of large prediction uncertainty even if the most likely outcome is no rain. Although it may seem far-fetched at first, the problem of climate projection is in fact similar in many respects to the garden party situation discussed above. So far, projections from multiple climate models were often aggregated into simple averages, standard deviations and ranges. One example is the recent Fourth Assess-ment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 396 Climatic Change (2010) 102:395–404 which was based largely on multi-model averages of the models participating in the World Climate Research Project (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) (Meehl et al. 2007). But is this the best use of the information? Or are we finally ready to move beyond the 'one-model-one-vote' approach? Some recent publications suggest that 'the end of model democracy' (a quote first used by Vladimir Kattsov at an IPCC meeting in 2006) may be near, but the problem is far from trivial. In this issue, Smith and Chandler (2010) propose that for rainfall over the Murray Darling basin in south east Australia, present-day precipitation mean and variability are useful indicators for the evaluation of models, and they find that models performing well today show a more similar trend in the future. At least in their case, eliminating poor models therefore decreases the spread of the ensemble. Although this is not always the case, similar findings for Alaska and Greenland are reported by Walsh et al. (2008). Ideas of down-weighting or eliminating models have been around for a while (Giorgi and Mearns 2002, 2003) but the widespread availability of perturbed physics and multi-model ensembles has sparked more interest in the community for methods to evaluate, combine and possibly weight models, and constrain projections using observations (Annan et al. 2005; Eyring et al. 2007; Forest et al. 2002; Furrer et al. 2007a, b; Greene et al. 2006; Hall and Qu 2006; Hargreaves et al. 2004; Jun et al. 2008a, b; Knutti 2008a; Knutti et al. 2009; Lopez et al. 2006; Murphy et al. 2004; Piani et al. 2005; R{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}nen 2005, 2007; Sanderson et al. 2008; Schmittner et al. 2005; Shukla et al. 2006; Tebaldi and Knutti 2007; Tebaldi et al. 2004, 2005; Tebaldi and Sanso 2009; van Oldenborgh et al. 2005; Weigel et al. 2008). In the following section, I try to summarize some of the pertinent questions that in my view remain unresolved in combining multiple models. There are of course several aspects where the analogy with the garden party above will fail. First, we are working with a forecast system that strictly speaking has never been proven to have skill, nor to be wrong, at least on the time scales of centuries. Second, we are dealing with a rather expensive garden party that involves billions of people and trillions of dollars. The decisions based on our forecasts might shape the world of the future, so a prediction that is overconfident might be an expensive failure. And finally, it is not just about deciding yes or no as in the case of the tent, but about deciding on one of many possible strategies based on an admittedly incomplete understanding of an extremely complex system. Accordingly, providing a clear recommendation for a way forward is far from trivial. 2 Making sense of multiple models},

@article{Pirtle2010,
abstract = {Climate modelers often use agreement among multiple general circulation models (GCMs) as a source of confidence in the accuracy of model projections. However, the significance of model agreement depends on how independent the models are from one another. The climate science literature does not address this. GCMs are independent of, and interdependent on one another, in different ways and degrees. Addressing the issue of model independence is crucial in explaining why agreement between models should boost confidence that their results have basis in reality. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Sanderson2015,
abstract = {The diverse set of Earth system models used to conduct the CMIP5 ensemble can partly sample the uncertainties in future climate projections. However, combining those projections is complicated by the fact that models developed by different groups share ideas and code and therefore biases. The authors propose a method for combining model results into single or multivariate distributions that are more robust to the inclusion of models with a large degree of interdependency. This study uses a multivariate metric of presentday climatology to assess both model performance and similarity in two recent model intercomparisons, CMIP3 and CMIP5. Model characteristics can be interpolated and then resampled in a space defined by independent climate properties. A form of weighting can be applied by sampling more densely in the region of the space close to the projected observations, thus taking into account both model performance and interdependence. The choice of the sampling distribution's parameters is a subjective decision that should reflect the researcher's prior assumptions as to the acceptability of different model errors.},
